# Rate Your Music Fast Search
This program utilizes command line arguments to quickly search the databases of rateyourmusic.com.

Usage:
* Artist Search: rym.py name of artist/band seperated by spaces.
* Film Search: rym.py **film** name of film seperated by spaces.
* Album Search: rym.py **album** name of album seperated by spaces.

_**Album Search** will only work for full lengths. Adding every release type is more effort than automating search is worth.*_
